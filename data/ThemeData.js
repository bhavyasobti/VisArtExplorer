      "Invitation Blurb": "For 10 years the VIS Arts Program, and before this the VIS Arts Show, have represented a mingling space, a space “to bring or mix together or with something else, usually without fundamental loss of identity” [Merriam-Webster].VISAP’22 will take place in a hybrid format, and we will therefore experiment with different forms of mingling, attempting to bridge and mix not only disciplines, methodologies and techniques but also the virtual and the physical, the immaterial and the material; people and artifacts online and offline, remote and on-site. In line with this experiment, we invite submissions that explore, re-interpret, speculate and reflect on the idea of mingling spaces.",

VISAP'21 proposes a space to reveal causes of disconnection, investigate ways of building and maintaining connections with others in our changing societies, cultures, and environments. We especially seek data-driven art and design that provokes alternative viewpoints to facilitate the discussion about connection and disconnection. ",
