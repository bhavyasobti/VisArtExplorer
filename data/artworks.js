This work was inspired by a mingling of research including serendipitous interactions, visualizations for public displays, and personal visualizations. SkyGlyphs is a nonconventional whimsical visualization, depicting datapoints as animated balloons in space. We designed it to encourage non-experts to casually browse the contents of a repository through visual interactions like linking and grouping of datapoints. Our contributions include SkyGlyphs’ representation and our design reflection that reveals a perspective on how to design delightful visualizations.", "link": "https://visap.net/2022/contributions/skyglyphs"},

Cosmologists say that most of the universe is structured by antimatter. We postulate that social media is similarly structured by effects of the unobserved discourse and experience. The backbone of a movement such as #MeToo is not based on the most-liked and most-retweeted, but by the masses of unobserved tweets. Vast numbers of #MeToo tweets that had no retweets and no likes nonetheless constituted acts of quiet testimony or unassuming solidarity. Conventional measures of network science thus fail to capture the true relevance of #MeToo.

In the installation space, one may see a collection of typographic posters displaying the tweets and listening to an ever-changing ambient sound. The present audiovisuals are created by an autonomous computational creative approach, which employs a neural classifier to recognise the emotional context of a tweet and uses this resulting data as feedstock for the audiovisual generation. The installation’s space was designed to promote an approach and blend between the online and physical perceptions of the same location. We applied multiple experiments with the proposed approach to evaluate the capability and performance. Also, we conduct interview-based evaluation sessions to understand how the installation elements, especially poster designs, are experienced by people regarding diversity, expressiveness and possible employment in other commercial and social scenarios.", "link": "https://visap.net/2022/contributions/essys-sharing-uc"},

This visualization project comes as a celebration of the fringe couples and families who have a multi-racial identity, effectively embodying the intermingling of races, and dissolving the systemic barriers put on their very own existence. According to the census, there are only vestiges of these multi-racial families until 1960. Prior to that, the census enumerator was responsible for categorizing persons, while after 1970 race was reported by someone in the household. In 1967, Loving v. Virginia ended restrictions on multi-racial marriage. Only after 2000 people can identify as being of multiple races. More recently, there has been a surge of multi-racial families in the data, but they are still a rarity, still mere traces of diversity in America. In this visualization you can see every registered multi-racial couple in America, for recent periods in 1-5% samples of the population, and for older periods in 100% samples of the population. Each couple is represented as a colorful chromosome, enabling you to see the races within each family, their ages, sexes, and children. For each year, these couples are organized by rarest multi-racial group first, by ascending average age of the couple, and by number of children. This means that in each group you will first see couples with no children, but as you navigate towards the end a group, you will see couples with more children. In 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ended restrictions on same-sex marriages. Only in recent years you will be able to see same-sex couples.

While stopped at a gas station one day to fill up my car, I noticed a pair of broken glasses on the ground near the pump, with a rusty paperclip nearby. I found it curious, so I snapped a picture.  The next time I filled up, I saw a battery that had been partially crushed.  I snapped a picture.  I was intrigued by these things that were discarded and left behind.  What was the story behind these items?  Most were likely dropped accidentally. But did their owners know they dropped them, and didn’t bother to pick them up? Or did they get home and wonder, where did I leave my comb? How many other people had walked past them?  Did they even notice them, or give them a second thought? I started to seek them out. I noticed patterns.  I would see similar objects at different gas stations, or the same object at the same station, weeks apart.", "link": "https://visap.net/2022/contributions/at-the-pump"},

Due to the lack of vaccines and cures for the illness, the reaction of various local governments was lockdowns of multiple scales that forced people to stay at home. On social media platforms like Instagram, which offer UI affordances to tag photographs in various places globally, this became impossible for many people due to lockdowns. People in lockdown started to re-appropriate these UI affordances not to locate themselves in a specific place but instead in a fictional place that reflected their condition instead of geographic coordinates.

Using this approach, we explored and extended the current boundary of cultural concerns of human beings. Human landmarks, such as buildings, streets, and cities, are usually named after famous people, important events, religious symbols, or a piece of collective memories. From Alexandra (named after the Macedonian King) to Hong Kong (meaning “fragrant harbour”), names of places are lyrical codenames that connect human emotions to a physical space. However, while these names last, the stories they tell often get forgotten. In this work, we propose a new, posthuman narrative for naming places. Microorganisms, the invisible lifeforms that pervade every micrometer of air, water bodies, and land on earth, coevolve and interact with the changing environment of the place they inhabit, accumulating genetic traits along the way. Just like gut microbiota that are unique for each individual human, the composition and genetic variations of the microbes in each location are also unique to that place, shaped by millennia of adaptation. Microorganisms narrate another kind of story, told through their genomes, where “collective memories” are a natural history in which anthropological activities play only a small part. Bacteria, the witness of human kings and heroes, wars and revolutions, ascent and extinction, are the rightful “namesake” of places. Using four landmarks in Hong Kong, a city tossed in endless political and cultural tides in the past 150 years, as our point of departure, we contemplated on the use of bacteria as a new narrative for the posthuman stories associated with places. Alongside the philosophical articulations, we also visualized this idea by fabricating an installation through the interdisciplinary use of 3D printing technology and microbiological procedures.", "link": "https://visap.net/2022/contributions/the-memory-of-street-hong-kong"},

It re-visits the composer’s classical compositions from an interdisciplinary viewpoint. The public could experience the musician's (in Seoul, it was a monk's) emotional state, which resulted in the movement of a circular knitting machine installation, visuals, and plotted pattern. The pianist’s affective response to music was captured every second and memorized in the knitted textile pattern, which was sprayed on the yarn before being knitted. High attention level resulted in a dense pattern, and the knitting machine’s speed followed the meditation level. All these processes were real-time and took place simultaneously.

Glyphs, in particular, have become an essential encoding tool due to their versatile applications in co-located multivariate volumetric datasets. While prior work has been conducted investigating the perceptual attributes of computationally-generated three-dimensional glyph-forms for scientific visualization, their affective and expressive qualities have yet to be examined. Further, our prior work has demonstrated the benefits of artist hand-created glyph forms in contrast to commonly-used synthetic forms in increasing visual diversity, discrimination, and expressive association in complex environmental datasets. In order to begin to address this gap, we establish preliminary groundwork for an affective design space for hand-created glyph forms, produce a novel set of glyph-forms based on this design space, describe a non-verbal method for discovering affective classifications of glyph-forms adopted from current affect theory, and report the results of two studies that explore how these three-dimensional forms produce consistent affective responses across assorted study cohorts.", "link": "https://visap.net/2022/contributions/affective-hand-sculpted-glyph-forms"},

There are already some scientific research results on forest carbon fixation, and a large amount of scientific data has been generated. However, these achievements and data are highly specialized, detached from daily life, and subsequently receive rare public attention. The physical space humans depend on is strongly interconnected, and forests and cities seem separate but mingling. The production and living of people produce lots of greenhouse gases, which need to be consumed by forest plants through photosynthesis, fixing CO2 in the form of organic carbon in the soil and biomass to ensure the carbon cycle. Industrialization has led to excessive CO2 emissions, causing severe disturbances to the carbon cycle process. At the same time, nature is constantly warning humanity, accompanied by frequent occurrences of extreme weather. Therefore, natural forest conservation and plantation forest management are crucial for future ecological civilization.", "link": "https://visap.net/2022/contributions/under-the-green"},

How shall we reclaim a tangible exchange with other parts of the world that has presence and meaning, as opposed to impersonal virtual interactions? We created and choreographed an art technology performance that allows viewers in Oklahoma City to immerse themselves in a collaborative narrative space between a dancer in the US and a robot arm in City University of Hong Kong's Studio for Narrative Spaces. The performance is shown in either online or offline form to audiences, who witness the narrative of a dancer and a robot who communicate with each other through movement, sometimes leading one another, sometimes frustrating each other, as if each are present to the other across a 12 hour divide. The dancer invites the machine to dance with her, but the machine quickly realizes that while it is not human, it can do things even the human dancer cannot accomplish. However the dancer is eager to control the technology she has invited, and will stop at nothing to get it to do what she wants to do. Without viewing the machine directly, the dancer relies on limited perspectives and sounds to enable bi-directional communication.

Visualisation makes the elegance and beauty of the molecular world visible in virtual space by representing molecular models as molecular surfaces portraying the interface between a protein and its environment.

The approach is empirically proven to be powerful for uncovering previously unseen structures in the data. While observing the results of the intermediate optimization steps of DR algorithms, we coincidently discovered the artistic beauty of the DR process. With enthusiasm for the beauty, we decided to look at DR from a generative art lens rather than their technical application aspects and use DR techniques to create artwork. Particularly, we use the optimization process to generate images, by drawing each intermediate step of the optimization process with some opacity over the previous intermediate result. As another alternative input, we used a neural-network model for face-landmark detection, to apply DR to portraits, while maintaining some facial properties, resulting in abstracted facial avatars. In this work, we provide such a collection of such artwork.", "link": "https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-visap-1061.html"},

Our application includes two distinct modes that invite casual creators to interact with deep convolutional neural networks to co-create custom artworks. The first mode, ‘magic markers’, mimics painting with a brush on a canvas, enabling users to paint a style onto selected areas of an image. The second mode, ‘compositing stamps’, uses a real-time method for applying style filters to selected portions of an image. Specifically, we focus on style transfer networks created from canonical and contemporary works of data visualization and data art. In addition to enabling a novel cre- ative workflow, the process of interactively modifying an image via multiple style transfer networks reveals meaningful features encoded within the networks, and provides insight into the effect particular networks have on different images, or even different regions of an image, such as border artifacts and spatial stability or instability. To evaluate Data Brushes, we gathered expert feedback from participants of a data science symposium and ran an observational study, finding that our application facilitates the creative exploration of neural style transfer for data art and enhances user intuition regarding the expressive range of particular style transfer features.", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8900858"},

What are the motivations behind this mapping endeavor? We analyze the technical aspects of OSM data for North Korea and the structured correspondence exchanged with 889 contributors. Our argument is that crowdsourced efforts can fill the knowledge gap resulting from physical, cultural, and political barriers associated with uncharted territories.

Corporations establish chains of such companies that move through \"conduit\" countries, often repatriating money back to the originating country. The exact amounts of money transferred between countries and the paths they follow are uncertain. This project combines various available data sources to explore the complex chains of investments, what we know about them, and what we don't.

It visualizes for the very first time literally traveling from everywhere to everywhere on this planet. Do all roads lead to Rome? This is the question which inspired the project “Roads to Rome” (Dec 2015) and its successor “Flights to Rome” (Jun 2018). The proverb “all roads lead to Rome” is, by a closer look, a very interesting suggestive mobility statement. The goal of R2R was to find an automated way to visualize this saying. All the resulting images were created by using a customized routing engine (Graphhopper + OpenStreetMap data) to calculate millions of routes from multiple starts to a single destination. F2R addresses two additional aspects the first iteration of the project couldn’t deliver back in 2015: 1. from really everywhere to everywhere on a global scale and 2. intermodal traveling of more than a single (road) mode of transport. As the visualizations of R2R relied on OpenStreetMap road data, it was conceptually never possible to render maps “leaving” a continent, as you simply can’t drive with a car from Europe to North America. By mining a 7 days dump of real-world global flight air traffic (week of Jan 9 to 15, 2017, data by FlightRadar24) to a route-able graph, by combining this flight graph with the existing global OpenStreetMap road data, and extending the open-source routing engine Graphhopper with an additional flight mode of transport, the authors were able to create a joint intermodal routing graph to calculate intermodal flight and road traveling routes in a realistic way.

But, in order to understand, critique, and shape the impact of machines seeing with abilities beyond human vision capabilities, humans will need to learn to see like machines, to understand their abstractions and their categorizations of things in the world. Computers that look at the world are not passive observers of reality but increasingly become active shapers of the reality we experience. Synthetic vision merits attention by artists/humanists as both a technological and cultural invention, particularly as a way to promote interdisciplinary knowledge that can create a space for public engagement. 20/X is an art and science project based on unseen images created by a state-of-the-art synthetic vision system. The title of the work refers to the measurement of perfect human vision (20/20), which is contrasted with a yet unquantifiable measure of seeing (specifically in a cultural context) for a synthetic vision system—represented by the variable \"X.\"", "link": "https://www.gardensandmachines.com/"},

The sound composition is produced by an image-processing interface selecting image areas and transforming them through frequency filtering, masking, and other methods, meanwhile converting them to sound. The interface operates in real-time and consists of settings visible over the image. The software additionally allows for full polyphonic sound through the build-up of multiple image regions operating simultaneously. The sounds are produced by two sonified regions. The first consists of the full image, providing a harmonic background over which a second contrasting voice is created based on smaller, selected regions of the image. This interplay can be equated to \"bass and counterpoint\" in traditional musical terms.

It has extended to the continuing typography research series from TYPE + CODE to TYPE Portrait. TYPE + CODE explored the aesthetic of code-driven typography by using primarily letter form. The computational visual outputs were original, exploratory, inventive, and novel. TYPE + CODE II used letterform, words, phrases, and sentences to explore expressive typographic forms and solutions using mathematic expressions, computer algorithms, and libraries. It conveys diversified visual messages inspired by nature, addressing environmental issues such as green design, healing through arts, exploring philosophical and religious interpretation regarding life, death, and love. TYPE+CODE III extended the aesthetic of code-driven typography from cyberspace to physical space by using digital fabrication such as laser cutting and 3d printing by using porcelain.

Floral Typography + CODE reinterprets floral typography to transdisciplinary typography as a generative typography system. A selfie is a form of art.

We further customized those patterns, and eventually combined them with other Spirographs to construct more complex ones. As those Spirographs patterns were well suited to segment time into hours or minutes with their “petals”, we investigated one particular scenario: Tweets visualization collected during CHI 2013, where each Tweet is represented as a particle that decorates the Spirographs. The resulting visualization is appealing and efficiently shows Tweets distribution over time and trends both during short and long time spans.
